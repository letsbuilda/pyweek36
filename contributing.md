# Contributing
To make sure everyone knows how to work with Git and GitHub, I'd like everyone to add their names to the end of this file.
To do this, you must clone this repository, create a new branch for your changes, check out the branch, make the changes,
commit, push, and finally request to merge into main.  

I agree that I have done those steps:
